# Drag'n'Code

### Short description
This site allows user to write a program without coding - by interacting with blocks visually and intuitively.
User can add the preset program blocks into the field, move and connect them by lines representing inputs and outputs of the program blocks.

![Sketched example of blocks' group](https://github.com/varivera/LabSSE/blob/folder-design/irek-nazmiev/img/example-sketch.png?raw=true)

There are 4 main types of blocks (and 9 blocks in common):
* Input
* Output
* Mathematical operations:
    * add
    * sub
    * mult
    * div
* String manipulation:
    * replace
    * isSubstring
    * concatenate

If all the structure is made right, it can be executed and result can be got.
